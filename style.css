/* final e.g */

/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: blue;

  /* rule 2 */
  .main #subsection {
   color: red;
  }

  /* n this final example, the first rule uses an ID selector, while the second rule combines an ID selector with a class selector. Therefore, neither rule is using a more specific selector than the other. The cascade then checks the number of each selector type. Both rules have only one ID selector, but rule 2 has a class selector in addition to the ID selector, so rule 2 has a higher specificity!

While the color: red declaration would take precedence, the background-color: yellow declaration would still be applied since thereâ€™s no conflicting declaration for it. */
